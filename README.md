I began this independent study to examine trends in ozone air quality for each county in California from 2018 through 2024 to quantify environmental and public-health effects using the COVID-19 lock-down 
period as a natural experiment. The analysis is concerned with characterizing those counties that saw dramatic shifts in ozone pollution, examining the urban-rural inequities, and describing associations
between ozone exposure and unhealthy AQI days.
Using R (tidyverse, ggplot2), I combined county-level yearly AQI datasets for EPA AirData and carried out descriptive, spatial, and inferential analysis. A Welch two-sample t-test for comparing
pre-COVID (2018â€“2019) and lockdown (2020) phases, and linear modeling for quantifying relations between ozone days and unhealthy AQI days among counties were performed. The project contains reproducible 
R scripts, figures, and an organized repository that complies with best practices for openness in research.
